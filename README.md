# hippie-christmas

Every year UW students move out of their houses and dorms and end up leaving a lot of stuff behind. Even during the year things are being thrown away. This app allows students to take a picture of whatever they are throwing out and drop a pin by the general area where they are leaving their free items. Other users can come by in that area and if they are within the GPS range of the pin drop they can take it off the free stuff market, and take the item home. 

“Help your things find a home” 

Take a picture or two of what you want to throw out, place it in a safe area, drop a pin on the map and allow others to grab it. Once the item is gone you or the person who took it can take the pin off the map. This is perfect during move-out and the bi-yearly “Hippy Christmas” that happens on campus.

Users are primarily UW students, but can always be anyone who lives in any neighborhood. Everyone is always recycling or throwing something away, so why not take advantage of finding someone's trash as your treasure.
